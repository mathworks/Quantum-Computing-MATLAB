# Quantum Classifier Network for MNIST Images  

This example simulates the training of a quantum neural network for a binary classification
task on the MNIST dataset. The data pre-processing and circuit structure is inspired from [1] and [2].

The training progress is displayed below and is comparable to Figure 3 of [1].
